### Source code for the paper titled "Optimization on black-box function by the parameter-shift rule"

*Author: Vu Tuan Hai.*

An attempt to apply quantum computing into the BBO field.

After finishing it, I feel it bullsh*t, pre-version was accepted at KSE2021, but I withdrew because of the conf fee.
